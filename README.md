# World_cup_database
A FreeCodeCamp relational database challenge

In this challenge I build a database worldcup. In this database, two tables are created: games and teams. The codes to rebuild the database are contained in worldcup.sql.
Then the bash script insert_data.sh is used to fill games and teams table from games.csv file.
Finally bash script query.sh is used to run few queries on games and teams
